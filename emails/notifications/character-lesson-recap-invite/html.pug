div Dear #{firstName},
br
div.
  Last week we launched a new beta of the ChinesePod “Recap” – a product that lets you do a quick review of lessons you
  learned recently. Even if you have only a quick moment – like 90 seconds – studies have shown that the pure fact that
  your brain gets exposed again to content recently learned increases retention dramatically.
br
div.
  So therefore, I really would love for you to check out #[a(href=recapUrl, title='Lesson Recap') Lesson Recap] and test the feature.
br
div And if you have any comments and ideas, we would love to hear it.
br
div.
  And of course if you have any comment on lessons, curriculum or your personal trajectory how to become a fluent
  Mandarin speaker, please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
